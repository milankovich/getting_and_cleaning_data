# getting and cleaning data Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

## Getting the raw data

The raw data should be downloaded and unzipped without changing names, from URL (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the general flow of the R analysis code, on how to transform the raw data to generate a tidy dataset that can be used for future processing. The variables are also described.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `data.txt`. It was uploaded to the course website separately.
